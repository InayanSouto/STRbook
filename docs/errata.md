**p. 20 (2019-03-28)**: Caption of Figure 2.3 should say “…is proportional to the number of observed birds…”  
**p. 71 (2019-09-19)**: Penultimate line should say "...of size 80km"  
**p. 54 (2019-10-31)**: Second paragraph, last line should start with "precipitation,..."  
  
**Explanatory note for 2020-07-22 errata**: In Ch. 1 &ndash; 3, the intercept variable “1” is listed along with *p* covariates. From Ch. 4 onwards, the intercept is absorbed into the covariate vector, **x**(**s**; *t*), which is specified there to be *p*-dimensional, in line with standard notation for multivariable regression. This leads to a slight abuse of notation and requires the following errata in Ch. 4 &ndash; 5.   
**p. 139 (2020-07-22)**: At the end of Section 4.1, add the sentence: “Note that in this and subsequent chapters, the covariate vector **x**(**s**; *t*) could include the variable “1,” which models an intercept in the multivariable regression.”   
**p. 140, line 22 (2020-07-22)**: Change “(*p* + 1) matrix given by…” to “*p* matrix given by…”   
**p. 152, Technical Note 4.2 (2020-07-22)**: Change “…column space of the *m* &times; (*p* + 1) design matrix **X**.” to “…column space of the *m* &times; *p* design matrix **X**.”   
**p. 223, line 3 (2020-07-22)**: Change “…is an *n* &times; (*p* + 1) matrix that could be time-varying…” to “…is an *n* &times; *p* matrix that could be time-varying…”
